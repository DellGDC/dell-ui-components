	<p>Since its creation, the role of npm has expanded to fulfill the broader needs of the JavaScript and Node.js developer community to include management of front-end web applications, mobile applications and other JavaScript development tools and frameworks. Today, the npm project and registry is hosted and managed as a free service by npm, Inc, supporting more than a billion downloads a month.</p>
