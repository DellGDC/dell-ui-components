	<h4>Git Workflow for Dell UI Components</h4>
    <p>We use a Feature Branch Workflow model. This model subscribes to the notion that all new features, bugfixes, or
        otherwise improvements get their own isolated branch. Once the work is fully developed, tested, and approved,
        then and only then does the branch get merged back. All new branches must start from the latest built and tested
        branch with the exception if the new feature is an extension of one already built and it would save time by continuing
        down a similar path.</p>
    <p>
        While there are a number of GUI tools to assist with this process, we are currently using SourceTree to manage
        all the various branches.
    </p>
    <h5>Here's how it works</h5>
    <p>The Feature Branch Workflow still uses a central repository, and master still represents the official project history.
        But, instead of committing directly on their local master branch, developers create a new branch every time they
        start work on a new feature. Feature branches should have descriptive names, like animated-menu-items or issue-#1061.
        The idea is to give a clear, highly-focused purpose to each branch.</p>
    <p>Git makes no technical distinction between the master branch and feature branches, so developers can edit, stage,
        and commit changes to a feature branch just as they did in the Centralized Workflow.</p>

    <p>In addition, feature branches can (and should) be pushed to the central repository. This makes it possible to
        share a feature with other developers without touching any official code. Since master is the only “special”
        branch, storing several feature branches on the central repository doesn’t pose any problems. Of course, this is
        also a convenient way to back up everybody’s local commits.</p>

    <h5>Pull Requests</h5>
    <p>Aside from isolating feature development, branches make it possible to discuss changes via pull requests.
        Once someone completes a feature, they don’t immediately merge it into master. Instead, they push the feature
        branch to the central server and file a pull request asking to merge their additions into master. This gives
        other developers an opportunity to review the changes before they become a part of the main codebase.</p>

    <p>Code review is a major benefit of pull requests, but they’re actually designed to be a generic way to talk
        about code. You can think of pull requests as a discussion dedicated to a particular branch. This means that
        they can also be used much earlier in the development process. For example, if a developer needs help with a
        particular feature, all they have to do is file a pull request. Interested parties will be notified automatically,
        and they’ll be able to see the question right next to the relevant commits.</p>

    <p>Once a pull request is accepted, the actual act of publishing a feature is much the same as in the Centralized
        Workflow. First, you need to make sure your local master is synchronized with the upstream master. Then, you
        merge the feature branch into master and push the updated master back to the central repository.</p>

    <p>Pull requests can be facilitated by product repository management solutions like Bitbucket Cloud or Bitbucket Server.
        View the Bitbucket Server pull requests documentation for an example.</p>

    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>The example included below demonstrates a pull request as a form of code review, but remember that they can serve
        many other purposes.</p>

    <h5>Mary begins a new feature</h5>

    {{New Feature Branch Image}}

    <p>Before she starts developing a feature, Mary needs an isolated branch to work on. She can request a new branch
        with the following command:</p>

    <code>git checkout -b marys-feature master</code>

    <p>This checks out a branch called marys-feature based on master, and the -b flag tells Git to create the branch
        if it doesn’t already exist. On this branch, Mary edits, stages, and commits changes in the usual fashion,
        building up her feature with as many commits as necessary:</p>
    <code>
    git status
    git add <some-file>
    git commit
    </code>
    <h5>Mary goes to lunch</h5>
    {{Git Workflows: Feature Commits}}

    <p>Mary adds a few commits to her feature over the course of the morning. Before she leaves for lunch, it’s a good
        idea to push her feature branch up to the central repository. This serves as a convenient backup, but if Mary
        was collaborating with other developers, this would also give them access to her initial commits.</p>

    <code>
    git push -u origin marys-feature
    </code>

    <p>This command pushes marys-feature to the central repository (origin), and the -u flag adds it as a remote
        tracking branch. After setting up the tracking branch, Mary can call git push without any parameters to push her
        feature.</p>

    <h5>Mary finishes her feature</h5>

    {{Git Workflows: Pull Request}}

    <p>When Mary gets back from lunch, she completes her feature. Before merging it into master, she needs to file a
        pull request letting the rest of the team know she's done. But first, she should make sure the central
        repository has her most recent commits:</p>

    <code>git push</code>

    <p>Then, she files the pull request in her Git GUI asking to merge marys-feature into master, and team members will
        be notified automatically. The great thing about pull requests is that they show comments right next to their
        related commits, so it's easy to ask questions about specific changesets.</p>

    <h5>Bill receives the pull request</h5>

    {{Git Workflows: Feature Pull Requests}}

    <p>Bill gets the pull request and takes a look at marys-feature. He decides he wants to make a few changes before
        integrating it into the official project, and he and Mary have some back-and-forth via the pull request.</p>

    <h5>Mary makes the changes</h5>

    {{Git Workflows: Central Repository Push}}

    <p>To make the changes, Mary uses the exact same process as she did to create the first iteration of her feature.
        She edits, stages, commits, and pushes updates to the central repository. All her activity shows up in the pull
        request, and Bill can still make comments along the way.</p>

    <p>If he wanted, Bill could pull marys-feature into his local repository and work on it on his own. Any commits he
        added would also show up in the pull request.</p>

    <h5>Mary publishes her feature</h5>

    {{Merging a Feature Branch}}

    <p>Once Bill is ready to accept the pull request, someone needs to merge the feature into the stable project
        (this can be done by either Bill or Mary):</p>

    <code>
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git pull origin marys-feature
    git push
    </code>

    <p>First, whoever’s performing the merge needs to check out their master branch and make sure it’s up to date.
        Then, git pull origin marys-feature merges the central repository’s copy of marys-feature. You could also use a
        simple git merge marys-feature, but the command shown above makes sure you’re always pulling the most up-to-date
        version of the feature branch. Finally, the updated master needs to get pushed back to origin.</p>

    <p>This process often results in a merge commit. Some developers like this because it’s like a symbolic joining of
        the feature with the rest of the code base. But, if you’re partial to a linear history, it’s possible to rebase
        the feature onto the tip of master before executing the merge, resulting in a fast-forward merge.</p>

    <p>Some GUI’s will automate the pull request acceptance process by running all of these commands just by clicking
        an “Accept” button. If yours doesn’t, it should at least be able to automatically close the pull request when the
        feature branch gets merged into master</p>

    <h5>Meanwhile, John is doing the exact same thing</h5>
    <p>While Mary and Bill are working on marys-feature and discussing it in her pull request, John is doing the exact
        same thing with his own feature branch. By isolating features into separate branches, everybody can work
        independently, yet it’s still trivial to share changes with other developers when necessary.</p>

    <h4>Where To Go From Here</h4>

    <p>For a walkthrough of feature branching on Bitbucket, check out the Using Git Branches documentation. By now, you
        can hopefully see how feature branches are a way to quite literally multiply the functionality of the single
        master branch used in the Centralized Workflow. In addition, feature branches also facilitate pull requests,
        which makes it possible to discuss specific commits right inside of your version control GUI.</p>

    <p>The Feature Branch Workflow is an incredibly flexible way to develop a project. The problem is, sometimes it’s
        too flexible. For larger teams, it’s often beneficial to assign more specific roles to different branches.
        The Gitflow Workflow is a common pattern for managing feature development, release preparation, and maintenance.</p>
