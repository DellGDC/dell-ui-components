	<p>Templates are in place for creating new components. All of the files needed to create a component are automatically placed in a directory that matches your component name.</p>
	<h3>How to create new component step by step</h3>
	<h4><span class="label label-default">Step 1</span> Open a git bash.</h4>
	<p>Open a git bash in your work directory for dell-ui-components. To do this, you can click on the working folder and click Git Bash</p>
	<p><img src="guide/images/open-git-bash.png"/></p>
	<p>If you don't see this you may need to install git so look in <a ui-sref="guide({section:'getting-started'})">Getting Started section</a>.

	<h4><span class="label label-default">Step 2</span> Enter grunt command</h4>
	<p>First think of what the new component name is going to be. Make sure you dasherize the component name when entering command to create the new component. Example</p>

	<div class="well well-black">
		<p>$ grunt component:my-new-cool-component</p>
	</div>

	<p>You should see the following response:</p>

	<div class="well well-black">
		<p>$ grunt component:my-new-cool-component<br/>
		Running "component:my-new-cool-component" (component) task<br/>
		Copying files for my-new-cool-component component<br/>
		Done copying files for my-new-cool-component component<br/>
		Configuring my-new-cool-component component<br/>
		Done configuring my-new-cool-component component<br/>
		</p>
		<p class="text-green">Done, without errors</p>
	</div>

	<h4><span class="label label-default">Step 3</span> Check for new files</h4>
	<p>If you open your editor you should now see new files for the new component.</p>
	<p><img src="guide/images/new-component-folder.png"/></p>
	<ol>
		<li>HTML for demo of the new component. This HTML code will be copied into the Dell Design Library content management system (DDL).</li>
		<li>JavaScript in the demo controller which is strictly for demo purposes. This should be rarely used unless it is a complex component. If the demo is dependent on this JavaScript it will have to be put into the DDL for the demo to work. <br/>
		<span class="label label-info">NOTE</span> Only use this JavaScript file for demo purposes like providing the component sample data. If the component has functionality that requires new JavaScript then follow instructions for <a ui-sref="guide({section:'adding-function-to-components'})">Adding Function to Components</a>.</li>
		<li>CSS/LESS for demo purposes. Sometimes the CSS in the DDL conflicts with the package. A good example is components that are supposed supposed to go full width but inside the demo container they don't display properly. In the demo code you will want to use the same ID that is produced by DDL and adjust css with this ID so that changes are scoped properly.</li>
		<li>Currently not used. It is meant for building of component playgrounds in the future.</li>
		<li>Currently not used. It is meant as a placeholder for a component thumbnail.</li>
		<li>Component specific CSS/LESS. This is the CSS that gets included in the package</li>
