	<p>When creating new components all the files that are needed are automatically created for you except for any functional JavaScript files that support component function. The reason  is that not all components require functional JavaScript.</p>
	<h4>Why controllers are not suitable for component function</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Note that the standard set of files does include a JS file called demo-my-component.js. If you look in this file it already has a controller ready to go. You could actually write JavaScript inside this controller that would enable plenty of function. However, if you were to actually use this file, the resulting JavaScript would never get put into the dell-ui-components package during the build process.</li>
		<li>In addition, the purpose of a controller in Angular should is to provide data to the scope. While it is fairly easy to write functions in controllers to to do things like manipulating the DOM in some way, controllers should only have data related business logic, not presentation logic. One of many reasons is because controller depends on an <code>ng-controller</code> reference in the HTML to work. That would require a lot of extra coding to get a component to There are other reasons why you don't want to use a controller for presentation functions and they are explained in <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/controller" target="_new">Angular's documentation</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Functions with Angular dependency</h4>
	<p>It is preferable to build presentation functions in a non-Angular method. The reason for this is that not all applications supported by dell-ui-components are Angular applications. For this reason, it is preffered that component functionality is built as a jQuery plugin and then an Angular directive be built to be used in the demo and Angular applications.</p>
	<p>Some component functions maybe put in place on an existing Bootstrap component that already has a jQuery plugin. A good example of this is Bootstrap's popover component.  A dell-ui-components <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/controller" target="_new">Angular directive</a> has been built to autoimatically wire the popover function to popover elements in Angular applications using dell-ui-components.</p>
	<p>In a non-Angular application, there would have to be a custom JavaScript function built to manually activate a popover element with Bootstrap's jQuery plugin.</p>

	<h4>Creating a plugin and directive to support an existing dell-ui-components component</h4>
	<h4><span class="label label-default">Step 1</span> Open a git bash.</h4>
	<p>Open a git bash in your work directory for dell-ui-components. To do this, you can click on the working folder and click Git Bash</p>
	<p><img src="guide/images/open-git-bash.png"/></p>
	<p>If you don't see this you may need to install git so look in <a ui-sref="guide({section:'getting-started'})">Getting Started section</a>.

	<h4><span class="label label-default">Step 2</span> Enter grunt command</h4>
	<p>First, remember that you will be adding this plugin to an existing component. Now enter the following:</p>

	<div class="well well-black">
		<p>$ grunt plugin</p>
	</div>

	<p><span class="label label-info">NOTE</span> You can also use an argument if you want the pluging name to be different that the component name.</p>

	<div class="well well-black">
		<p>$ grunt plugin:my-custom-plugin-name<br/>
	</div>


	<p>You should see the following response:</p>

	<div class="well well-black">
		<p>$ grunt plugin:my-custom-plugin-name<br/>
		Running "plugin" (plugin) task</p>
		<p><span class="text-blue">? </span>Which component is this plugin for? (Use arrow keys)<br/>
		<span class="text-blue">> global</span><br/>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;alerts<br/>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;announcements<br/>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;banner<br/>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;breadcrumbs<br/>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;standard-buttons<br/>
		 (Move up and down to reveal more choices)
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>Select component and hit enter.</p>

	<h4><span class="label label-default">Step 3</span> Check for new files</h4>
	<p>If you open your editor you should now see new files for the existing component. Example "overflow-tabs" plugin for the "tabs" component. tabs.js is the file for Angular directive:</p>	
	<p><img src="guide/images/new-component-plugin.png"/></p>


	<h4><span class="label label-default">Step 4</span> Understand the jQuery plugin template structure.</h4>
	<p>Take a look at your new dellUI.myCustomPluginName.js</p>	
	<p><img src="guide/images/plugin-structure.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
	<p>Looking at the code above you should notice the usage of dellUImyCustomPluginName. If you are familiar with jQuery plugins you will understand that plugins are typically used on a jQuery selector. </p>
	<p>Let's say you have a component which has a class name "foobar".  Say that any element tagged with this class name should have a function alter it somehow. At the very minimum you would initiate the plugin as such: </p>

	<p><code>$(".foobar").myCustomPluginName();</code></p>
	<p>With options you would use something like:<br/>
		<code>$(".foobar").myCustomPluginName({option1:true,option2:false});</code>
	</p>

	<h4><span class="label label-default">Step 5</span> Wiring the jQuery plugin to the Angular demo via directive.</h4>
	<p>Take a look at your new my-custom-component.js (in the example above its called tabs.js)</p>	
	<p><img src="guide/images/directive-structure.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
	<p>The example above wires any element that has a class name of "my-custom-component" and executes the jQuery plugin on that element. You can build on this basic example to do more complicated things. Take a look at the tabs component.</p>
	<p>For more information on directives, take a look at <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive" tagetr="_new">Angular directives</a> documentation.




	<h4>Creating an Angular Directive only.</h4>
	<p>In summary, the steps above will fit most of your needs. However, sometimes there might be a Bootstrap component that already has a jQuery plugin but youare seeking to somehow enhance it without altering the Bootstrap functionality. A good example of this is Bootstrap toggling functions that don't work properly in an Angular application because when the Bootstrap plugins fire the DOM may not be fully rendered.</p>	
	<p>If you look at the directives folder you will see such a directives file (toggle.js).<br/>
	<img src="guide/images/directives-folder.png"/></p>
	<p>This directive helps an Angular application properly initiate Bootstrap elements that use the data-toggle attribute.</p>
	<p>To create a directive, follow the steps above using a different grunt command</p>
	<div class="well well-black">
		<p>$ grunt directive:my-custom-plugin-name</p>
	</div>
