	<h4>General</h4>
	<p>
		Your code should not stick out â€” make it consistent with the rest of the code you are contributing to. You will see this rule stressed over and over throughout the guidelines and when submitting fixes or new components.
	</p>

	<h4>Indenting and white space</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Set your editor to 4 spaces per tab.</li>
		<li>Use tabs to indent blocks.</li>
		<li>Avoid lines longer than 80 characters.</li>
		<li>If a line longer than 80 characters is broken up with a comma, the line below should be indented.</li>
		<li>In general, you use one tab per expression level.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Use of Comments</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Be generous with comments.</li>
		<li>It is useful to leave information that will be read at a later time by people (possibly yourself) who will need to understand what you have done.</li>
		<li>The comments should be well-written and clear, just like the code they are annotating.</li>
		<li>It is important that comments be kept up-to-date.</li>
		<li>Erroneous comments can make programs even harder to read and understand.</li>
		<li>Make comments meaningful.</li>
		<li>Focus on what is not immediately visible. Don't waste the reader's time with stuff like <code>i = 0; // Set i to zero.</code></li>
		<li>Generally use line comments (//). Save block comments (/* */) for formal documentation.</li>
	</ul>
